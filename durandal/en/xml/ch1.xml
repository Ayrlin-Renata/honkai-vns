            A young girl is inside the ИНТЕРКОСМОС (INTERKOSMOS), a machine that once helped astronauts get to the Moon nearly half a century ago. 
            By adjusting the gravity settings, she's able to train for longer periods while reducing the damage and tear done to her joints. 
            Valkyrie Durandal begins a new day of training.
    
            Rita comes to tell Durandal breakfast is ready. Today's dessert is Mille-feuille, known as the Napoleon. 
            Durandal is startled Rita called her using her real name, Bianka. Today, February 29th, is a special day worth commemorating, hence the name and the cake. 
            It's been 4 years since that fateful day when she met her and them. It's been so long she even has gotten used to be called "Durandal". 
            Soon Bishop Otto will put in motion his plan, and eventually they'll be able to make good on the promise they made. 
            Fulfilling that promise is the top priority of the girl known as Bianka.

			The Leviathan has made its nest somewhere nearby, making it very hard for the people of the island to go fishing. 
			They're so afraid they haven't been able to group together and build a ship big enough to deal with it. 
			It may be strong, but there is nothing humans can't overcome. 
			After all a few hundred soldiers were able to win against 100.000 enemies in the Spanish Conquest of Peru. 
			Miguel is from Spain, before he came to this world by accident he was not only a veteran soldier who fought in the Battle of Lepanto, but also a cultured person who published several books. 
			He's not sure if they are still popular 400 years later, but some of his books were "La Galatea", "The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda" and "Don Quixote of La Mancha". 
			He's Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, the greatest Spanish writer in the world and one of the most important figures in the history of literature.

                <p class="article-text-h">Note：</p>
                <p class="article-text">ᴳᵀ Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547 ~ 1616) is the greatest writer in the Spanish literary world, and even Spanish is called "the language of Cervantes" ". His "Don Quixote" is considered to be the first "modern novel" in the history of literature.</p>
                <p class="article-text">ᴳᵀ Cervantes participated as an ordinary soldier in the Battle of Lepanto on October 7, 1571. In an official report written eight years later, he wrote: "... In this naval battle, Cervantes had a high fever and his condition was very poor. The company commander and his comrades told him: You are in a bad situation and should be lying in the room of the sailboat. Cervantes accused: What do you say, I have not fulfilled my obligations, rather than fearing the dead ghost, I would rather fight for the sake of God and the king ... In this way, he and his comrades-in-arms, as the company commander ordered, fought against the Turks in this battle. After the battle, General Juan knew his heroic performance and gave him four extra gold coins ... During the battle, he suffered two injuries to his chest and hands, and his left hand was crippled.
