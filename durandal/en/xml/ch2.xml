            <speak chara="_Otto">Luckily for us, by using materials left by the previous civilization we were able to create several experimental devices which allow us to move back and forth between the Sea of Quanta and our world——</speak>
            <speak chara="_Otto">——The name of that device is "Gnius".</speak>
            <speak chara="_Otto">In theory, by using the Gnius a person is able to return from the "projected worlds" at any moment——</speak>
            <speak chara="_Otto">But if one were to start from this side, our "reality", it can only be used when an extremely rare "space-time window" appears due to technical difficulties.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Otto">The next time the "window" will appear is on February 29th between 11:15 and 12:15, near the Fjord 1054 in the Northeast Greenland National Park. It will remain open for approximately 100 seconds.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Otto">This event is rarer than the transit of Venus—— It could be centuries until the next window appears.</speak>
            <speak chara="_Otto">——What do you think? Doesn't it make you excited?</speak>
